        <pre>TinkerHub NSSCE, the non-profit founded in 2014, is an organization working in alignment with the sustainable development goals of quality education, decent work, and economic growth.

            Skill poverty has long-lasting repercussions in the Indian job environment where skill mismatch and underqualified graduates are the reasons for a massive unemployment rate. In a few years, unemployment is feared to become the cause of a greater economic disruption, with aftershocks that will have social, political, and economic dimensions.
            
            TinkerHub Foundation was born out of our understanding of the above. Today, the community hosts, co-hosts, and partners with learning initiatives all over the country. For the next two years, our goal is to enable industry-relevant technology education to over 10,000 students across 300 colleges.
